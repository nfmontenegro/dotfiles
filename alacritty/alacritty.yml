# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

  # If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.

  # `infocmp xterm-256color`.

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Possible values for `animation`
# `Ease`
# `EaseOut`
# `EaseOutSine`
# `EaseOutQuad`
# `EaseOutCubic`
# `EaseOutQuart`
# `EaseOutQuint`
# `EaseOutExpo`
# `EaseOutCirc`
# `Linear`
#
# To completely disable the visual bell, set its duration to 0.

# visual_bell:
#   animation: EaseOutExpo

# Key bindings
#
# Each binding is defined as an object with some properties. Most of the
# properties are optional. All of the alphabetical keys should have a letter for
# the `key` value such as `V`. Function keys are probably what you would expect
# as well (F1, F2, ..). The number keys above the main keyboard are encoded as
# `Key1`, `Key2`, etc. Keys on the number pad are encoded `Number1`, `Number2`,
# etc.  These all match the glutin::VirtualKeyCode variants.
#
# Possible values for `mods`
# `Command`, `Super` refer to the super/command/windows key
# `Control` for the control key
# `Shift` for the Shift key
# `Alt` and `Option` refer to alt/option
#
# mods may be combined with a `|`. For example, requiring control and shift
# looks like:
#
# mods: Control|Shift
#
# The parser is currently quite sensitive to whitespace and capitalization -
# capitalization must match exactly, and piped items must not have whitespace
# around them.
#
# Either an `action`, `chars`, or `command` field must be present.
#   `action` must be one of `Paste`, `PasteSelection`, `Copy`, or `Quit`.
#   `chars` writes the specified string every time that binding is activated.
#     These should generally be escape sequences, but they can be configured to
#     send arbitrary strings of bytes.
#   `command` must be a map containing a `program` string, and `args` array of
#     strings. For example:
#     - { ... , command: { program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] } }
# Mouse bindings
#
# Currently doesn't support modifiers. Both the `mouse` and `action` fields must
# be specified.
#
# Values for `mouse`:
# - Middle
# - Left
# - Right
# - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# Values for `action`:
# - Paste
# - PasteSelection
# - Copy (TODO)
